                    <h2>Tuesdays with Morrie (1995)</h2>
                    <p>Mitch Albom's book, Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, A Young Man and Life's Greatest Lesson (1997), entered the poet's life during a time when death and terminal illness were affecting her immediate family and one of her closest friends. This life-affirming case study, the result of a series of taped conversations between Albom and his beloved undergraduate professor, the late Morrie Schwartz, represents good art in the Deweyian sense because it flows from everyday life experience. It inspired the poet to interact with the book through her own hybrid African American cultural lens and create new work.</p>
